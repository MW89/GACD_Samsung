## Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

> **Contents**: quick guide for R script run_analysis.R including several steps to create a tidy data set from given Samsung accelerometer data.

The tasks of the course project were to create a R script "analysis.R" which:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The R script run_analysis.R provides enough comments which contain all relevant information.

The file "code book.txt" is a modified version of "features_info.txt" from the original data and contains further descriptions.

> Having the unzipped folder "UCI HAR Dataset" in the working directory is **required** to run the "run_analysis.R" script.
